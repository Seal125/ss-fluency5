# Directions

Using the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), answer the following questions. If you want, you can use async/await, but you can also use fetch and then methods! **Be sure to include error handling as well. If you're using async/await, look up the try/catch method for error handling.**

1. Write a function, `getUsers`, that returns a promise with an array of user objects.

2. Write a function, `companyInfo`, that returns a promise with an array of the company name and their website. It should be formatted like the following: `companyName`, `website`.

3. Write a function, `incompleteTasks`, that returns a promise with a number of todos that are incomplete.

4. Write a function, `hasWord`, that takes in a parameter of a string and returns a promise with an array of the post(s) that include(s) that word.

5. Write a function, `longestTitle`, that returns a promise with the post that has the longest title.

6. Write a function, `emails`, that returns a promise with an array of emails from each user.

7. Write a function, `userTasks`, that takes a user ID and returns a promise with an array of user todos based on the user ID.
